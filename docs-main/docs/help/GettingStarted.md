# Getting Started

1. Get your `client_id` and `client_secret` from us via [wealthkernel.com/enquiries](https://www.wealthkernel.com/enquiries).

2. Retrieve an `access_token` by authenticating. See [Authentication](#authentication).

3. Create your first party. See [Create a party](#create-a-party).

4. Create your party's first portfolio. See [Create a portfolio](#create-a-portfolio).

5. Fund your first portfolio by creating a deposit. See [Create a deposit](#create-a-deposit). Your customer will need to transfer the amount to us with the reference and from the bank account detailed in the created deposit. Once we have received the money we will match the transfer with the deposit and fund the portfolio.

6. View your first portfolio's transactions. See [List transactions](#list-transactions).
